        <h2 class="mb-4 text-2xl">November 2015</h2>
        <ExpandableImageComponent src="https://i.imgur.com/LwgzXC6.jpg" class-list="rounded-md shadow-md mb-4"/>
        <p class="mb-4">The first iteration of my website, when I first learnt that coding existed! This website features gradients, box shadows and even glow effects (probably took me 2 weeks to figure that one out).</p>
        <p class="mb-4">It does, however, include a projects page. In the screenshot below there are a few projects that would not have existed at the time, but the database it used has since been updated, so it displays them.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-8 mb-4 text-2xl">September 2016</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Moving onto the next year, we can see I've effectively learnt how to nest boxes within eachother, but the header does have some fancy navigation links which I think, even today, look quite nice.</p>
        <ExpandableImageComponent src="https://i.imgur.com/COZDbyc.jpg" class-list="rounded-md shadow-md mb-4" />
        <p class="mb-4">There's some garish looking colours on this page, but this is what the projects page looked like. The heading of the page is decorated and there seems to be functionality for differentiating between complete and work in progress projects.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">As I was playing around with this version of the website, if you hovered over each project they would tilt, adding some animation to the site!</p>
        <h2 class="mt-8 mb-4 text-2xl">July 2017</h2>
        <ExpandableImageComponent src="https://i.imgur.com/PkKlXw2.jpg" class-list="rounded-md shadow-md mb-4" />
        <p class="mb-4">A massive difference!</p>
        <p class="mb-4">This version of my website posseses a fancy looking landing page, with a heading clearly stating my name and profession. As you will see, the theme of having a landing page continues as I feel it gives a clean and more visual way of introducing the user to the website.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">As this is only a static image, you will not be able to see the animation present on this page, but the different angled panels slowly slide over each other.</p>
        <ExpandableImageComponent src="https://i.imgur.com/i0RUNHZ.jpg" class-list="rounded-md shadow-md mb-4" />
        <p class="mb-4">Referring to the screenshot of the projects page above, the heading of the page is decorated at 2 of the corners diagonally. These had a hover animation which would move further away from the title.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Each individual project now has an image displayed with it, which shows the user what they can expect from it. These were lazy loaded, so each image would load at different times. I didn't really like the look of that in the end as it felt as though the website was slow to load.</p>
        <h2 class="mt-8 mb-4 text-2xl">May 2019</h2>
        <ExpandableImageComponent src="https://i.imgur.com/pqeS7t1.jpg" class-list="rounded-md shadow-md mb-4" />
        <p class="mb-4">At the time of writing this blog post, this is the current version of my website! The landing page has a heading with my name and profession, with an animated background.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">The background is from <LinkComponent to="https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js" target="_blank">particles.js</LinkComponent>, a friend of mine introduced me to this library and it was used as the background of the loughborough.tech website. I thought it was too good to leave out of my personal one.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">The navigation bar is now situated on the far left-hand side, occupying the full height of the page. This is a big difference from the earlier version which opted for the top full-width headers.</p>
        <ExpandableImageComponent src="https://i.imgur.com/3YT4x14.jpg" class-list="rounded-md shadow-md mb-4" />
        <p class="mb-4">For the projects page, the content of the page has a fixed width, allowing the user to have an easier reading experience. Each project is now displayed row-by-row with a short summary of what the user can expect.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">This is an early version of the website, so does not have all content or every design aspect fleshed out, but it has a more modern and layed out structure so enables me to extend and maintain this version of the website more efficiently.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">Overall, I think it's possible to see how both my design and web development skills have improved, which has in turn allowed my to express the design choices I was making better.</p>
